 * Event Bus Stack
 *
 * This stack creates an Amazon EventBridge event bus, which acts as a central hub for
 * sending and receiving events in our application.
 *
 * An event bus is like a message board where different parts of our application can post
 * messages (events) and other parts can listen for and react to those messages. It helps
 * decouple different components of our application and enables event-driven architectures.
